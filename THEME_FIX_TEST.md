# Theme Text Visibility Fix - Testing Guide

This document outlines the changes made to fix the white text visibility issues and how to test them.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **White Text on White Background**
- **Problem**: Headers like "careers worldwide", "learn from industry experts", "everything you need to succeed", and testimonial names were appearing in white text and invisible on white backgrounds.
- **Root Cause**: Overly aggressive CSS inheritance rules in dark mode were causing color conflicts.

### 2. **Missing Theme Control on Public Pages**
- **Problem**: Users couldn't switch themes on the landing page and other public pages.
- **Solution**: Added theme toggle to the public header.

### 3. **CSS Specificity Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Dark mode overrides were too broad and caused inheritance issues.
- **Solution**: Refined CSS selectors and added specific color enforcement.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Fixes (`/src/index.css`)
- **Lines 428-430**: Fixed overly broad `inherit` rule that was causing color conflicts
- **Lines 490-521**: Added specific color enforcement for custom color classes
- **Enhanced dark mode support**: Added proper light/dark color mappings for custom colors

### 2. Theme Context Enhancement (`/src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- **Lines 14-44**: Improved theme initialization with system preference detection
- **Added CSS re-computation**: Forces browser to recalculate styles on theme change

### 3. Public Header Updates (`/src/components/layout/PublicHeader.jsx`)
- **Added ThemeToggle**: Users can now switch themes on public pages
- **Enhanced responsive design**: Theme toggle available on both desktop and mobile
- **Improved dark mode styling**: All header elements now properly support dark mode

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache**
```bash
# In browser DevTools (F12)
# Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
# Or manually clear site data
```

### 2. **Test Theme Switching**
1. Open the landing page
2. Look for the theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in the header
3. Click to switch between light and dark modes
4. Verify all text remains visible in both modes

### 3. **Test Specific Problem Areas**

#### Landing Page Headers
- ✅ **"Everything you need to succeed"** (Section title)
- ✅ **"Learn from industry experts"** (Section title) 
- ✅ **"Careers worldwide"** (Stats section)
- ✅ **"Transforming careers worldwide"** (Testimonials section)

#### Testimonial Names
- ✅ **Sarah Johnson** (Software Engineer at Google)
- ✅ **Michael Chen** (Product Manager at Microsoft) 
- ✅ **Emily Rodriguez** (UX Designer at Adobe)

#### Navigation Elements
- ✅ **SkillLink logo text**
- ✅ **Navigation menu items** (About, Learn, Partners, etc.)
- ✅ **Sign In / Get Started buttons**

### 4. **Test Both Themes**

#### Light Mode
- All dark blue text (`#191961`, `#2d2b69`) should be clearly visible
- Headers should appear in dark blue
- Body text should be in dark gray/black

#### Dark Mode  
- Custom colors should appear in lighter variants for visibility
- Headers should appear in light blue/white
- Body text should be in light gray/white

### 5. **Mobile Testing**
- Open responsive design view (F12 → Device Icon)
- Test theme toggle in mobile menu
- Verify all text is visible on smaller screens

## Color Mappings

### Light Mode
- `text-[#191961]` → Dark blue (#191961)
- `text-[#2d2b69]` → Dark blue (#2d2b69)
- Body text → Dark colors

### Dark Mode  
- `text-[#191961]` → Light blue (#8b94db)
- `text-[#2d2b69]` → Light blue (#9ca3e8)
- Body text → Light colors

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Browser Cache Issues

If text is still invisible after applying fixes:

1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Clear site data**: DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data
3. **Disable cache**: DevTools → Network → Disable cache (while DevTools open)

## Additional Notes

- The theme preference is saved to localStorage
- System theme preference is detected automatically on first visit
- All CSS transitions are smooth (0.3s duration)
- Glassmorphism effects are preserved in dark mode
- The fixes maintain accessibility standards

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check if theme class is applied to `<html>` element
2. Verify CSS custom properties are loading correctly
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Try in an incognito/private window
